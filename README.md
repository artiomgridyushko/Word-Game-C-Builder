# Word-Game-C-Builder
The project is a word game developed in the C++ Builder environment. The game loads an array of words from a text document and presents the player with a scrambled word with two letters added. The player must enter the correct word that matches the description.

# Game-description
For each of the three levels in the game there are separate files named `words1.txt`, `words2.txt` and `words3.txt`. Each of these files contains a list of words corresponding to a certain difficulty level.

Game description:
"The computer selects a random word from the list. Next, several random letters are added to the selected word, which are then mixed and displayed on the screen. The player's task is to complete the levels in the shortest time. The game includes three difficulty levels:

- Simple: words up to 5 letters,
- Medium: words from 5 to 8 letters,
- Complex: words over 8 letters.

At each level, the player is given five words to guess. The player can make a mistake no more than two times per level. The theme of the game covers fruits, vegetables and berries.

Player results are saved to the `result.txt` file, which is used to record and display player achievements."
